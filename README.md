# voting-portal-2.0
The app for the Voting Portal for The Democracy Straight-Up Project rebuilt for API.

This project started in the repo voting-portal, which is now depricated.

Zaman, what applications were used in the old voting portal app?  Python, Django API?  

What will be used in the new voting portal, i.e., what is different, what are you doing to it. 

Let's make this readme file useful to new people collaborating on the project.
